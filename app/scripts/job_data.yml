      App for capstone project to track workout using Kinect cameras
    long_description: |
      Created for 4th Year Engineering Science Capstone Design, in a team of 4.
      <p></p>
      Developed Android app that was to be used in companion with the rest of the IronEye system to
      provide novice lifters a safe way to learn proper weight lifting technique
      at their own pace by using a real time display to show errors in the their form,
      and to serve as a means of tracking and recording workouts.
      <p></p>
      The mobile app notifies the user when their form is incorrect,
      and after the workout, it can be used to view statistics, charts, and re-watch their previous workouts.
